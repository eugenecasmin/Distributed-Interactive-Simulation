# UAVDR

This repository contains versions of my Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) term project. 

The aim of the project was/is to model the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to augment wireless networks needs in a disaster recovery enviroment 
using distributed simulation techniques with (High Level Architecture) HLA infrastructure. The project is written in C# owing to its .NET compliant nature. 

Although very robust, the comprehensive report included in the zip file serves to walk you through the design aspects and what was done during the project. The
report has specifications ranging from model engineering of the federation and subsequent feederates in the framework on SimGe software to improvements that 
could be made to make the project more practical from a simulation perspective.

The project itself, whose title has been compressed to 'UAVs in Disaster Recovery' or 'UAVDR' for short, was a success and the score awarded for the final 
submission was the maximum score, 100.
